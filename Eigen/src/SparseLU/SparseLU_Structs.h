/* 
 * NOTE: This file comes from a partly modified version of files slu_[s,d,c,z]defs.h
 * -- SuperLU routine (version 4.1) --
 * Univ. of California Berkeley, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center,
 * and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.
 * November, 2010
 * 
 * Global data structures used in LU factorization -
 * 
 *   nsuper: #supernodes = nsuper + 1, numbered [0, nsuper].
 *   (xsup,supno): supno[i] is the supernode no to which i belongs;
 *  xsup(s) points to the beginning of the s-th supernode.
 *  e.g.   supno 0 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4   (n=12)
 *          xsup 0 1 2 4 7 12
 *  Note: dfs will be performed on supernode rep. relative to the new 
 *        row pivoting ordering
 *
 *   (xlsub,lsub): lsub[*] contains the compressed subscript of
 *  rectangular supernodes; xlsub[j] points to the starting
 *  location of the j-th column in lsub[*]. Note that xlsub 
 *  is indexed by column.
 *  Storage: original row subscripts
 *
 *      During the course of sparse LU factorization, we also use
 *  (xlsub,lsub) for the purpose of symmetric pruning. For each
 *  supernode {s,s+1,...,t=s+r} with first column s and last
 *  column t, the subscript set
 *    lsub[j], j=xlsub[s], .., xlsub[s+1]-1
 *  is the structure of column s (i.e. structure of this supernode).
 *  It is used for the storage of numerical values.
 *  Furthermore,
 *    lsub[j], j=xlsub[t], .., xlsub[t+1]-1
 *  is the structure of the last column t of this supernode.
 *  It is for the purpose of symmetric pruning. Therefore, the
 *  structural subscripts can be rearranged without making physical
 *  interchanges among the numerical values.
 *
 *  However, if the supernode has only one column, then we
 *  only keep one set of subscripts. For any subscript interchange
 *  performed, similar interchange must be done on the numerical
 *  values.
 *
 *  The last column structures (for pruning) will be removed
 *  after the numercial LU factorization phase.
 *
 *   (xlusup,lusup): lusup[*] contains the numerical values of the
 *  rectangular supernodes; xlusup[j] points to the starting
 *  location of the j-th column in storage vector lusup[*]
 *  Note: xlusup is indexed by column.
 *  Each rectangular supernode is stored by column-major
 *  scheme, consistent with Fortran 2-dim array storage.
 *
 *   (xusub,ucol,usub): ucol[*] stores the numerical values of
 *  U-columns outside the rectangular supernodes. The row
 *  subscript of nonzero ucol[k] is stored in usub[k].
 *  xusub[i] points to the starting location of column i in ucol.
 *  Storage: new row subscripts; that is subscripts of PA.
